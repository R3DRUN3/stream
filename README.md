Reference implementation of CI pipeline steps via [*Dagger*](https://dagger.io/) modules 🏗️  

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- [Dagger CLI](https://docs.dagger.io/install)

## Instructions
If you are new to **Dagger** I really suggest to take a look at the [**official documentation**](https://docs.dagger.io/) first.  
Once you gain a better understanding of the tool, inspect all the sub-repositories and have fun!  
If you want to integrate these modules into your CI/CD engines, take a look at [this guide](https://docs.dagger.io/user-guide/ci/).
